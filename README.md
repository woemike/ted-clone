## TEDx Clone

*This template does not work on its own*. It is missing the Ionic library, and AngularJS.

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project and download a release of Ionic separately.

A mobile application design to practice: TEDx Clone.
